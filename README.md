# Example Project for QueryDSL EntityQL

This repository is a part of [EntityQL](https://github.com/eXsio/querydsl-entityql) project.
It is a fully functional and configured Spring Boot based project that shows how to use EntityQL.

From this Examples Project you can find out just how easy it is to...
- configure EntityQL with Spring
- configure Maven to generate Static Query Models
- Build JPA or Spring Data JDBC Entities that are compatible with EntityQL
- Use Dynamic and Static Query Models (JPA or Spring Data JDBC) to build and execyte fast, native SQL queries using 
fluent, readable and type safe Java API

Feel free to clone it and play around with the examples to see just how convenient it is to use EntityQL.
